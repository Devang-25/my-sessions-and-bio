## Title
Cloud Datalab: Jupyter with the power of BigQuery and TensorFlow

## Duration
45 min

## Agenda
In this session we will explain how you can use Google Cloud Datalab—a Jupyter environment from Google that integrates BigQuery, TensorFlow, and other Google Cloud services seamlessly—to easily run SQL queries from Jupyter to access terabytes of data in seconds, train a deep learning model with TensorFlow with tens of GPUs in the cloud, and apply your models to the dataset with a little work, with all the usual tools available on Jupyter.
