### Title

- ML Ops and Kubernetes Pipelines: solutions and best practices for DevOps of production ML services 
- ML Opsとは：機械学習の実運用のためのソリューションとベスト・プラクティス

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and database engineers. Intermediate level (requires no ML expertise)

### Short Agenda (50 words)
This session features the concept of "ML Ops" (DevOps for ML), solutions and best practices bringing ML into production service. We will learn how to combine Google Cloud Kubeflow Pipelines for building a data pipeline for continuous training and validation, version control, scalable serving, and ongoing monitoring and alerting.

### Agenda (85 words)

Creating an ML model is just a starting point. To bring the technology into production service, you need to solve various real-world issues such as: building a data pipeline for continuous training, automated validation of the model, version control of the model, scalable serving infra, and ongoing operation of the ML infra with monitoring and alerting. In this session, we will learn concepts of "ML Ops" (DevOps for ML) and how to combine Cloud Kubeflow Pipelines to build a production ML service infra.
