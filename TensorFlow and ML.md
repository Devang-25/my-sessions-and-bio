## Target audience and level: 

Developers and ITDMs. Beginner level (no requires ML expertise)

## Agenda

TensorFlow, the open source library for machine learning from Google, has been democratizing the world of machine intelligence since its launch in 2015. With TensorFlow, combined with the scalability of Google’s Cloud AI Platform, now anyone can leverage deep learning technology at low cost and without much expertise. We will explore examples of business that have adopted TensorFlow and Cloud AI to solve their real-world problems: a cucumber farmer in Japan who was able to build a deep learning-based cucumber sorter by himself, a used car auction service using TF for classifying car models and parts, and a food manufacturer that has been able to increase productivity significantly in their baby food factory.

機械学習 (ML) の真価は AI の実装に留まりません。これまでの IT 開発とは異なる「計算機の新しい使い方」を切り拓く能力にあります。 ML 時代の新しい IT 開発とはどのようなものか。Google Cloud の導入によって「現場で使える ML」がどのように実現されるか。Google 最新の ML 技術動向について、各分野での導入事例も交えて紹介します。
