## Title
AutoML Vision and Edge TPU: bringing TensorFlow Lite models to edge devices

## Session duration

about 45 min

## Target audience
Data scientists, ML engineers, mobile developers, embedding systems engineers

## Short agenda (less than 400 chars)
AutoML Vision allows you to upload the images with labels, press a Train button and wait for a day to get a image recognition model with the state of the art accuracy. Without any ML expertise, you can easily train the image recognition model at the Cloud, exporting the TensorFlow Lite model, and use it at mobile devices, RasPi and Edge TPU with super low latency and power consumption.

## Long agenda
AutoML Vision from Google Cloud automates the process of vision recognition model training with Google's state of the art technologies such as meta learning (learning2learn) and Network Architecture Search (NAS) technology combined with transfer learning, data augmentation and so on. You can just upload the training data with labels, press a Train button and wait for 24 hours to get a ML model with the cutting edge accuracy.

AutoML Vision now supports exporting of TensorFlow Lite model for prediction on smartphones, small devices (such as RasPi) and Edge TPU, the hardware accelerator developed by Google. So you can bring the power of AutoML to those edge devices and achieve significantly shorter latency on image classification.

In this session we will see how the whole process work. Without any ML expertise, you can easily train the image recognition model at the Cloud, exporting the TensorFlow Lite model, and use it at small devices with short latency and low power consumption.
