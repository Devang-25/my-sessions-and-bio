## Title
PDF2Audiobook: How to read more books and lose your weight with the power of AI

## Session duration

about 45 min

## Target audience

Developers and ML beginners

## Agenda
I had two problems: I've got too many unread books in PDF and got too much weight. I decided to build my PDF2Audiobook tool so I can listen to the audiobooks while jogging. But the challenge is how to remove the noisy garbage texts from the OCR result to generate audiobook quality reading voice. In this session, we'll see how you can combine Cloud Vision, AutoML Tables, Text-to-Speech and Cloud Functions for OCR, document layout and content recognition, and high quality reading voice generation. You may be able to read more books and lose your weight at the same time, with the power of AI.
