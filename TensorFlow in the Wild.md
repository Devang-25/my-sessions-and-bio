# TensorFlow in the Wild (or the Democratization of Machine Learning)

### Time: 45 min

### Target audience: Developers and ITDMs. Requires no ML expertise

## Agenda

TensorFlow, the open source library from Google, has been democratizing the world of machine intelligence 
since its launch in 2015. With TensorFlow, combined with the scalability of Googleâ€™s Cloud Machine Learning 
Engine, now anyone can leverage deep learning technology cheaply and without much expertise. We will explore 
three examples of business that have adopted TensorFlow and Cloud ML to solve their real-world problems: 
a cucumber farmer in Japan who was able to build a deep learning-based cucumber sorter by himself, a used car 
auction service using TF for classifying car models and parts with 86x better training performance, and a 
global insurance company that has been able to increase prediction accuracy significantly on accident cases.
