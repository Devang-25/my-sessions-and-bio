### Title

- TensorFlow Enterprise: Productionizing TensorFlow with Google Cloud
- TensorFlow EnterpriseとGoogle Cloudによる機械学習の実運用導入

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and DevOps engineers. Intermediate level (requires no ML expertise)

### Agenda

The hardest part of ML adoption in enterprise is Productization. As we see in recent discussions around "ML Ops", there are many gaps between Data Scientists' PoC Notebook and production ML system manageable by an Ops team. Questions would be "How to deploy the Notebook on cloud in a scalable, portable and manageable way?", "How to process millions of rows of data from a Notebook at cloud scale and speed?", "How to get professional technical consulting for TensorFlow applications?" and so on. In this session, we will see how TensorFlow Enterprise solves these problems with Google Cloud for productionizing your TensorFlow code for mission critical business operation.
