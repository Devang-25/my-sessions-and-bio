### Title

- ML Ops Best Practices on Google Cloud
- ML Ops のプラクティスとGoogle Cloudでの実践

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and database engineers. Intermediate level (requires no ML expertise)

### Agenda

Creating an ML model is just a starting point. To bring it into production, you need to solve various real-world issues, such as building a pipeline for continuous training, automated validation of the model, scalable serving infrastructure, and supporting multiple environments in increasingly common hybrid and multi-cloud setups. In this session, we will learn the concept of "ML Ops" (DevOps for ML) and how to leverage various Google initiatives like TFX, Kubeflow Fairing (Hybrid ML SDK) and Kubeflow Pipelines to build and maintain production quality ML systems.
