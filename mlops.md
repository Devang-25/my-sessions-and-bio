### Title

- ML Ops Best Practices with TensorFlow Enterprise and Google Cloud
- TensorFlow EnterpriseとGoogle Cloudで実践するML Ops のベストプラクティス

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and DevOps engineers. Intermediate level (requires no ML expertise)

### Agenda

Creating an ML model is just a starting point. To bring it into production, you need to solve various real-world issues, such as building a pipeline for continuous training, automated validation of the model, scalable serving infrastructure, and supporting multiple environments in increasingly common hybrid and multi-cloud setups. In this session, we will learn the concept of "ML Ops" (DevOps for ML) and how to leverage Google's Cloud and AI technologies including TensorFlow Enterprise, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and AI Platform to build and maintain scalable and production quality ML systems.
