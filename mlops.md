### Title

- Productionizing ML with ML Ops and Cloud AI
- ML OpsとCloud AIで実現する機械学習のプロダクション導入

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and DevOps engineers. Intermediate level

### Agenda

The hardest part of ML adoption in enterprises is Productinization. As we see in recent discussions around ML Ops, there is a big gap between Data Scientists' PoC code and production ML development and operation with the Ops team. Such as, preparing a manageable ML dev environment, building a scalable ML serving infrastructure, setting up a ML pipeline for continuous training, and automated validation of data and model. In this session, we will learn how to leverage various Google's ML/AI offerings such as TensorFlow Extension (TFX), TensorFlow Enterprise, Cloud AI Platform Notebooks, Training, Prediction, and Pipelines for productionizing your ML service with the ML Ops best practices.
