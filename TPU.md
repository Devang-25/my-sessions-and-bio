## Session duration

about 45 min

## Target audience

Smart phone developers

## Abstract: 

This session takes a detailed look at the architecture of Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We’ll cover quantization, CISC design, as well as the systolic array matrix unit that is the heart of the device. You’ll learn how a minimalistic design philosophy and a tight focus on neural network inference use-cases enabled Google to build and deploy such a high-performing device in just 15 months.
