Even if you have terabytes of business data on your databases and data warehouses, it's not so easy to apply AI-based analytics on it. The bottleneck is Machine Learning (ML) expertise and scalable infrastructure. With AutoML Tables from Google Cloud, you can hire an "AI data scientist" on your console, and let it build a
ML model from your business data with a single click, without any coding, for various applications incl. demand forecasting, marketing analytics and optimization, recommendation etc. Also, BigQuery ML allows you write a simple ML model inside SQL and run it against terabytes of data within tens of seconds, without any serious effort on 
building a scalable infrastructure for data analytics. In this session, we will see how those technology accelerates AI-based analytics on your business data.
